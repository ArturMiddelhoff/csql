This directory contains a batch file that will process all files
in the include directory. Afterwards the result is compared 
with the expected output in the reference directory.

Because some tests will emit file paths the tests will only
pass if the path of the input directory is
	D:\src\Tools\sqtpp\test\cmd\input
and the path of the reference directory is
	D:\src\Tools\sqtpp\test\cmd\reference

Note: Case matters.
